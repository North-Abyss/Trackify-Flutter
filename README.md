# Trackify

A Flutter habit-tracking application built as a learning project during the **100 Days of Code challenge**. Trackify helps users build and maintain positive habits by providing a clean, intuitive interface to track daily habit completion. It includes a historical **Time Matrix**, a global cooldown timer engine, and an automated multi-platform CI/CD pipeline.

## 📱 Features

- **The Time Matrix** - A historical 10-year calendar that visualizes completion history with custom-colored markers.
- **Habit Dashboard** - View active habits, cooldown timers, streaks, and quick actions in one place.
- **Advanced State Memory** - Habits remember exactly when they were completed, including current streaks and midnight reset behavior.
- **Add/Edit/Delete Habits** - Full CRUD operations for managing habits.
- **Local Storage** - Data is persisted instantly to the device using SharedPreferences.
- **Theme Customization** - Support for custom dynamic themes, accent palettes, and Material You-style color selection.
- **Import / Export Backup** - Save and restore habit data as JSON directly from the Settings screen.
- **Cloud CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated GitHub Actions release builds for Android, Windows, and Linux on every `v*` tag.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Trackify follows a clean architecture pattern with a clear separation of concerns.

### State Management
- **Provider** (`provider: ^6.1.5+1`) - Used for reactive state management.
  - `HabitProvider` - The universal heartbeat engine. Handles CRUD, streak logic, cooldown timers, persistence, import/export, and historical completion tracking.
  - `ThemeProvider` - Handles theme mode switching, accent colors, and custom theme loading.
  - `UserProvider` - Tracks user progression and XP-style interactions from the dashboard.

### Data & UI Integrations
- **Table Calendar** (`table_calendar: ^3.2.0`) - Renders the historical Time Matrix and dynamic completion dots.
- **SharedPreferences** (`shared_preferences: ^2.5.5`) - Local device storage for habits and metadata.
- **UUID** (`uuid: ^4.5.3`) - Generates unique identifiers for habits.
- **Dynamic Color** (`dynamic_color: ^1.8.1`) - Supports Material You-style dynamic theming when available.
- **File Picker** (`file_picker: ^11.0.2`) - Native JSON import/export UI for backups.
- **Flutter Launcher Icons** (`flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.14.4`) - Generates cross-platform app icons.

### Key Components

#### Models (`lib/models/`)
- `Habit` - Core habit model with built-in memory for `completedDates`, `currentStreak`, cooldown timing, and metadata.
- `UserProfile` - User information and preference model.

#### Screens (`lib/screens/`)
- `DashboardScreen` - Main habit list, create/edit dialog, timer overview, and navigation to the calendar/settings/profile views.
- `CalendarScreen` - The Time Matrix historical view powered by `table_calendar`.
- `ProfileScreen` - User profile summary and related app interactions.
- `SettingsScreen` - Theme, data backup, and JSON import/export controls.

#### Widgets (`lib/widgets/`)
- `HabitCard` - Reusable habit card UI for the dashboard.
- `LevelProgressBar` - Visual progress indicator for user progression.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (version `3.8.1` or higher)
- A connected device or emulator

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/North-Abyss/Trackify-Flutter.git
cd Trackify-Flutter
```

2. Get dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app locally:
```bash
flutter run
```

## ☁️ Cloud Compilation (CI/CD)

Trackify ships with a fully automated release workflow in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

By pushing a `v*` tag, GitHub Actions builds and uploads:

- **Android:** Universal APK and split APKs for ABI-specific installation.
- **Windows:** Native `.exe` installer and portable `.zip` bundle.
- **Linux:** Native `.deb` package and portable `.zip` archive.

The `./git-sync.sh` helper can be used to sync your local branch with GitHub and trigger the release pipeline.
